# Intel(R) Data Analytics Acceleration Library Apache Arrow\* Samples

Apache Arrow\* samples for the Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel® DAAL) are designed to show how to use this library with the Apache Arrow* library in a C++ application.

Unzip the archive with Intel® DAAL samples to your working directory (`<sample_dir>`).

## System Requirements
You can use Intel(R) DAAL Apache Arrow\* samples on Linux\*, Windows\*, and macOS\* operating systems. For a list of Intel(R) DAAL hardware and software requirements, refer to release notes for the version of Intel(R) DAAL you are using.

### Apache Arrow\* implementations against which Intel(R) DAAL has been validated:
- Apache Arrow\* 0.15.0

**Note:** Intel(R) DAAL is expected to work on higher Apache Arrow\* versions as well. Let us know if you have any troubles with the distribution you are using.

## Preparation Before Build and Run
### Apache Arrow\* support
You can download and install the Apache Arrow\* library from the [https://github.com/apache/arrow][arrow_repo]. Before running the sample make sure to set the environment variables `ARROWROOT` and `ARROWCONFIG` with the correct path and build type (debug or release, see [https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/docs/source/developers/cpp.rst#building][arrow_building] web page for details). For Linux\* and MacOS\* only: set variables `BOOST_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH` with the correct path to `libboost_system.a` and `BOOST_FILESYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH` with the correct path to `libboost_filesystem.a`.

### Setting Up the Build Environment
Before you build the sample, you must set certain environment variables that define the location of related libraries. Intel(R) DAAL includes the `vars` scripts that you can run to set environment variables:

- On Windows\*, you can find the `vars.bat` batch file at `<install-dir>\compilers_and_libraries_xxxx.x.xxx\windows\daal\bin\:
vars.bat intel64`
- On Linux\*, you can find the `vars.sh` shell script at `<install-dir>\compilers_and_libraries_xxxx.x.xxx\linux\daal\bin:
source vars.sh intel64`
- On macOS\*, you can find the `vars.sh` shell script at `<install-dir>\compilers_and_libraries_xxxx.x.xxx\mac\daal\bin:
source vars.sh`
For more information about setting environment variables and configuring Intel(R) DAAL, refer to Getting Started guides for the library.

## Build and Run Instructions
### On Windows\*
To build Intel(R) DAAL Apache Arrow\* C++ samples, go to the C++ Apache Arrow\* samples directory and execute the `launcher` command with the `build` parameter:

```
cd <sample_dir>\cpp\arrow

launcher.bat intel64 build
```

The command creates the `.\_results\intel64` directory and builds `*.exe` executables, as well as creates a log file for build results.

To run Intel(R) DAAL Apache Arrow\* C++ samples, go to the C++ Apache Arrow\* samples directory and execute the `launcher` command with the `run` parameter:

```
cd <sample_dir>\cpp\arrow

launcher.bat intel64 run
```

Select the same architecture parameter as you provided to the launcher command with the build parameter.

For each sample, the results are placed into the `.\_results\intel64\<sample name>\.res` file.

### On Linux\*
To build Intel(R) DAAL Apache Arrow\* C++ samples, go to the C++ Apache Arrow\* samples directory and execute the `make` command:

```
cd <sample_dir>/cpp/arrow

make {libintel64|sointel64} compiler={intel|gnu} mode=build
```

From the `{libintel64|sointel64}` parameters, select the one that matches the architecture parameter you provided to the `vars.sh` script and that has the prefix that matches the type of executables you want to build: `lib` for static and `so` for dynamic executables.

The command creates a directory for the chosen compiler, architecture, and library extension (`a` or `so`). For example: `_results/intel_intel64_a`.

To run Intel(R) DAAL Apache Arrow\* C++ samples, go to the C++ Apache Arrow\* samples directory and execute the `make` command in the run mode. For example, if you run the `vars` script with the `intel64` target:

```
cd <sample_dir>/cpp/arrow

make libintel64 mode=run
```

The `make` command builds a static library for the Intel(R) 64 architecture and runs the executable.

### On macOS\*
To build Intel(R) DAAL Apache Arrow\* C++ samples, go to the C++ Apache Arrow\* samples directory and execute the `make` command:

```
cd <sample_dir>/cpp/arrow

make {libintel64|dylibintel64} compiler={intel|gnu} mode=build
```

From the `{libintel64|dylibintel64}` parameters, select the one that matches the architecture parameter you provided to the `vars.sh` script and that has the prefix that matches the type of executables you want to build: `lib` for static and `dylib` for dynamic executables.

The command creates a directory for the chosen compiler, architecture, and library extension (`a` or `dylib`). For example: `_results/intel_intel64_a`.

To run Intel(R) DAAL Apache Arrow\* C++ samples, go to the C++ Apache Arrow\* samples directory and execute the make command in the run mode. For example, if you run the `vars` script with the `intel64` target:

```
cd <sample_dir>/cpp/arrow

make libintel64 mode=run
```

The `make` command builds a static library for the Intel(R) 64 architecture and runs the executable.
