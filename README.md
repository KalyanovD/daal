# Intel(R) Data Analytics Acceleration Library
Intel(R) Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel(R) DAAL) helps speed up big data analysis by providing highly optimized algorithmic building blocks for all stages of data analytics (preprocessing, transformation, analysis, modeling, validation, and decision making) in batch, online, and distributed processing modes of computation.

## Installation
You can install Intel DAAL from the provided binary packages or from the GitHub* sources.

For platform-specific getting started documents, see the following pages:

* [Getting Started with Intel(R) Data Analytics Acceleration Library for Windows*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-daal-for-windows)
* [Getting Started with Intel(R) Data Analytics Acceleration Library for Linux*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-daal-for-linux)
* [Getting Started with Intel(R) Data Analytics Acceleration Library for macOS*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-daal-for-osx)

### Installing from the Binaries
You can download an archive from the GitHub\* release page at [https://github.com/01org/daal/releases](https://github.com/01org/daal/releases). This archive contains a script to set the environment variables for library usage in the *daal/bin* directory.

If you have issues with running the script, you may need to replace the *INSTALLDIR* string in *daal/bin/daalvars.sh* and/or *daal/bin/daalvars.csh* with the name of the directory where you unpacked the archive.

### Installing from the Sources

#### Required Software
* C/C++ compiler (see [System Requirements](#system-requirements))
* Java\* JDK (see [System Requirements](#system-requirements))
* Microsoft Visual Studio\* (Windows* only)
* [Git Large File Storage (LFS) extension](https://git-lfs.github.com)
* [http://msys2.github.io](http://msys2.github.io) with the msys/make package (Windows* only); install the package as follows:

        pacman -S msys/make

#### Installation Steps
1. Clone the sources from GitHub* as follows:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/01org/daal.git

2. Set the PATH environment variable to the MSYS2\* bin directory (Windows* only); for example:

        set PATH=C:\msys64\usr\bin;%PATH%

3. Set an environment variable for Microsoft Visual Studio\* (Windows* only); for example:

        call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" amd64

4. Set an environment variable for one of the supported C/C++ compilers

5. Set an environment variable for one of the supported Java* compilers; for example:

        set PATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_77\bin;%PATH%
        set INCLUDE=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_77\include;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_77\include\win32;%INCLUDE%

6. Install Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks (Intel(R) TBB) (Windows* only)

    Download and install free Community License Intel TBB.
    See [this page](https://registrationcenter.intel.com/en/forms/?productid=2558&licensetype=2) for more details.

    Copy Intel TBB header files and libraries into Intel DAAL folder. E.g.:
        xcopy /I /Y /Q /E "C:\Program Files (x86)\IntelSWTools\compilers_and_libraries_2017.2.187\windows\redist" %DAALDIR%\externals\tbb\win\redist
        xcopy /I /Y /Q /E "C:\Program Files (x86)\IntelSWTools\compilers_and_libraries_2017.2.187\windows\tbb" %DAALDIR%\externals\tbb\win\tbb

7. Build Intel DAAL via the command-line interface with the following commands, depending on your platform:

 *  on Linux\* using Intel(R) C++ Compiler:

            make daal PLAT=lnx32e

 *  on Linux\* using GNU Compiler Collection\*:

            make daal PLAT=lnx32e COMPILER=gnu

 *  on macOS* using Intel(R) C++ Compiler:

            make daal PLAT=mac32e

 *  on macOS\* using Clang\*:

            make daal PLAT=mac32e COMPILER=clang

 *  on Windows* using Intel(R) C++ Compiler:

            make daal PLAT=win32e

 *  on Windows\* using Microsoft Visual* C++ Compiler:

            make daal PLAT=win32e COMPILER=vc

Built libraries are located in the *\_\_release\_{os_name}/daal* directory.

## Python*
Intel DAAL can be also used with Python\* interfaces. You can find the pyDAAL package at [http://anaconda.org/intel/pydaal](http://anaconda.org/intel/pydaal).
